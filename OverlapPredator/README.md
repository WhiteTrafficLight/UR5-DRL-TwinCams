# **OverlapPredator (Modified Version)**
This repository is a modified version of **[OverlapPredator](https://github.com/overlappredator/OverlapPredator)**.

## **ðŸ“Œ What's Modified?**
This version includes several modifications and additional experimental scripts:
- **ROS-based real-time point cloud registration** (`ros_nodes/`)
- **Performance enhancements using Maximal Clique (MAC)** (`scripts_experimental/`)
- **Multi-cloud registration experiments**

For details on these modifications, refer to `scripts_experimental/` and `ros_nodes/`.
